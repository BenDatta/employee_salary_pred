# **💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Linear Regression**


🚀 Overview
**This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline built to predict employee salaries based on key features like age, gender, degree, job title, and years of experience. Using Linear Regression, I built a model that achieved strong accuracy and offers real-world applicability for HR analytics and compensation benchmarking.
